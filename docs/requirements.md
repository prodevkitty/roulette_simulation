This is for Roulette betting mechanism.
1. Payment Feasibility Analysis System
Objective: Before each round, check whether the payment of prizes to players does not compromise the bank's profit margin.
How it Works:
	⦁ Real-Time Query: Before the play is validated, the system performs a complete analysis of the impact of the player's potential win on the bank's profit margin.
		- Betting History: Analyzes the player's betting and winning history to understand risk behavior.
		- Current Bank Balance: Checks the current bank balance and makes gain/loss projections, considering all active players.
		- Payout Cap: Determines a maximum prize amount that can be paid to the player based on the current health of the bank and ongoing bets.
		- Possibility of Redistribution: If a player has a win that exceeds the cap, the system can redistribute this prize more gradually or stagger the payment.
Example:
	⦁ Player A bets 50 thousand. If he wins, the potential prize is 150 thousand.
		- The system checks whether paying this amount will compromise the bankroll's 50% profit margin.
		- If it does, the system dynamically adjusts the prize amount to an amount that the bankroll can afford to pay without loss.
2. Real-Time Player Profile Analysis
Objective: Adjust each player's odds based on their profile and history, to ensure that the game remains profitable and does not become predictable.
How it Works:
	⦁ Risk Profile: The system assigns a risk profile to each player, based on:
		- Total amount wagered on the game.
		- Betting frequency and progression.
		- History of wins and losses.
		- Behavior patterns, such as initial high bet or constant and progressive bets.
	⦁ Dynamic Odds Update: The system adjusts the winning odds for each round based on the profile, ensuring that the bankroll is maintained:
		- Players with recent big wins can have their winning odds adjusted downwards, avoiding a vicious pattern of consecutive wins.
		- New players or players with few wins may be given a slightly higher chance of winning to encourage them to continue betting.
Example:
	Player B is identified as a consistent bettor who increases his bets progressively. His winning odds are adjusted to maintain a balance, preventing an excessive win that would compromise the bankroll balance.
	Player C makes irregular bets and wins frequently. The system detects this behavior and adjusts his odds to prevent a winning streak that would affect the bankroll margin.
3. Preventing Addiction and Maintaining Profitability
Goal: Prevent players from developing addictive winning patterns and prevent the bankroll from being overloaded with excessive payouts.
How it Works:
	⦁ Dynamic Bet and Win Limits:
		- On each round, the system checks whether a player is about to win disproportionately and adjusts the maximum amount he can win.
		- The payout cap can be adjusted for each round based on betting behavior.
	⦁ Diversification of Results:
		- Results are distributed so that there are always winners and losers in each round, keeping the player interested in continuing.
		- The system can apply small losses to winners and small wins to losers, creating a continuous betting cycle.
Example:
Player D has already won in several rounds in a row. The system adjusts his winning limit to prevent him from continuing to make excessive profits and reduces his chances of winning, keeping him engaged without compromising the bankroll.
4. Real-Time Simulations and Adaptive Adjustments
Objective: Run real-time simulations to predict risk scenarios and adjust the game so that the bankroll remains profitable.
How it Works:
	⦁ Impact Simulations: With each new high-value bet, the system runs simulations to predict the impact of this bet on the bankroll balance, evaluating:
		- Probability of the player winning.
		- Financial impact of a possible payout.
		- Necessary adjustments to protect the bankroll.
	⦁ Real-Time Adjustments: Based on the results of the simulations, the system adjusts the odds, losses or prizes of the round before authorizing the start of the game.
		This may include applying partial or total losses.
		It may also mean redistributing the prizes gradually or progressively.
Example:
A player bets 200 thousand. The system runs a simulation and finds that a full payout would seriously affect the bankroll margin.
The system adjusts the maximum payout he can receive and applies a partial loss if he loses, ensuring that the bankroll remains healthy.
5. Intelligent Bet Redistribution
Objective: Redistribute a portion of the bets to the players, maintaining the feeling of progression and encouraging them to continue playing.
How it Works:
	⦁ Dynamic distribution: 20% of bets are redistributed among players, with adjustments based on partial and total losses.
		Players who lose partially stay in the game, creating a continuous cycle of bets.
	⦁ radual payout: The system can scale payouts so that players do not win large prizes all at once, distributing prizes in phases.
Example:
	Player E loses 30k in a round, but the system returns a portion of this loss (e.g. 5k) as an incentive for him to keep betting.
	Player F wins 50k, but the payout is scaled over three rounds, allowing him to stay in the game longer and spend his winnings progressively.

6. Continuous Monitoring and Machine Learning
Incorporate a machine learning system to improve the analysis of player behavior over time. The algorithm can identify game patterns and adjust the mechanics as players change their strategies, preventing abuse and maximizing profitability.
Conclusion: A system that combines real-time analysis, dynamic adjustments and simulations can ensure the game is profitable without compromising the player experience. By constantly checking the bankroll and making intelligent adjustments to odds and prizes, you can create a balanced and stimulating game without locking players into a predictable pattern of winning or losing.
