-------For analyze the perfomance of machine learning model----------
To analyze the performance of the machine learning model in the Roulette betting project, you can follow these steps:

Split the Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the Model: Train the model using the training set.
Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model using the testing set.
Performance Metrics: Use appropriate performance metrics to analyze the model's performance.
Cross-Validation: Optionally, use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
Step 1: Split the Data
Ensure that the data is split into training and testing sets. This is already done in the train_model function using train_test_split.

Step 2: Train the Model
The model is trained using the training set in the train_model function.

Step 3: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model using the testing set and calculate performance metrics.

Step 4: Performance Metrics
Use appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to analyze the model's performance.

Step 5: Cross-Validation
Optionally, use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Explanation:
Performance Metrics: The train_model function now calculates and prints the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
Precision: The proportion of true positive instances among the instances classified as positive.
Recall: The proportion of true positive instances among the actual positive instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative instances.
Cross-Validation: The train_model function also performs 5-fold cross-validation and prints the cross-validation scores and their mean.

Running the Project
1. Generate Synthetic Data: Run the Python script to generate synthetic data.
    >> python generate_test_data.py

Install Python Dependencies: Ensure all Python dependencies are installed.
    >> pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Main Script: Run the main script to test the entire project and analyze the model's performance.
    >> python main.py

This setup will generate synthetic data, load and preprocess the data, train the model, simulate the game flow, and analyze the model's performance using various metrics.
